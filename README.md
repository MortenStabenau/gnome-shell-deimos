# Deimos Gnome Theme
This is a dark gnome shell theme with red accents. It works really well with
the [Numix GTK Theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme).

## Installation
1. Download the [latest
release](https://github.com/MortenStabenau/gnome-shell-deimos/releases/latest).
There are two versions of this theme: the Arch Linux version and the default
one. The only difference is the small Arch icon in the top left, which does not
exist in the default version.
2. Extract the .zip to your .themes folder.
3. Install and enable the User Themes shell extension.
4. Use the gnome-tweak-tool to enable the theme (Appearance/Shell Theme)

If you do not want to use the provided zip files, you can also build this theme
yourself.

## Building
You will need to have SASS installed. Then you can run: `./compile`

## Thanks
This theme is based on [zukitre by
lassekongo83](https://github.com/lassekongo83/zuki-themes). It uses the Arch
Linux logo extracted from the official [Art
page](https://www.archlinux.org/art/).
